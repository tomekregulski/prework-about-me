      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I am musician, and also work in the natural food and beverage
        industry.<br /><br />
        As a musician, I've actually used coding in some of my work! I've used C
        to program sonic events from scratch, and used them in conjunction with
        recorded sounds to create interesting combinations. I have also used the
        language Lisp in conjunction with another aplication to process live
        sound through various algorithms, creating real-time "improvisations" in
        response to other musicians, or even just the soundscape of a
        location.<br /><br />
        In my day job, I (in normal times) manage a national field marketing
        team that helps natural food brands build their customer base and
        maintain shaelf presence. I hope to use the skills that I build in this
        program to develop new projects for my company that will help us achieve
        a higher level of functionality and competitiveness.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up grew up on Long Island.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        I love to cook, and strive to make something new every month or so. It
        doesn't always work out that way, but I try! I also love to brew and
        drink rare teas. It is like meditation to me :)
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        I would love to ultimately settle on a freelance lifestyle that gives me
        the flexibility to work on my music while managing a small group of
        clients.

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>New York City</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        The company that I am currently working with has a series of objectives
        that require web and app development. I saw this as a great opportunity
        to create a more vital position for myself within the company, and my
        proposal was met with great enthusiasm. So, I am here!
